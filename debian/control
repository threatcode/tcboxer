Description: Framework to manage applications in containers
 Built for Kali Linux (and other Debian-based) systems, Kaboxer is a framework
 providing seamless integrations between applications shipped in containers and
 the host system.
 .
 It allows shipping applications that are hard to package properly or that need
 to run in isolation from the rest of the system.
 .
 The "kaboxer" command line tool can be used to:
 .
  - build container images
  - retrieve container images
  - run applications out of those containers
  - integrate those applications in the host system
